# comments
a simple repo about comments in a code base
What are comments?

comments are basically text notes added to the program to provide explanatory information about the source code.

a comment is a programmer-readable explanation or annotation in the source code of a computer program. They are added with the purpose of making the source code easier for humans to understand, and are generally ignored by compilers and interpreters.

Depending on the goal behind writing a comment in your code base,they are neccessary for easy understanding especially in a team

They are used in a programming language to document the program and remind programmers of what tricky things they just did with the code and also helps the later generation for understanding and maintenance of code.
